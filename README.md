# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling within route handlers. Specifically, the example shows a route that queries a database, but fails to handle potential errors gracefully, resulting in unhelpful responses to clients and difficulties in debugging.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database. However, it lacks proper error handling. If the database query fails, a generic error message is sent to the client, and only a console error is logged on the server.  This makes it hard to identify and fix the underlying database issue.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It includes comprehensive error handling, providing informative error messages to the client while also logging detailed errors for debugging.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies (you'll need to configure your database connection). 
3.  Run `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version). 
4.  Try to access a route that might cause a database error (e.g., an invalid user ID).

Observe the difference in error handling and logging between the two versions.
